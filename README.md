# Binding of Zelda

Startdocument of **Victor Peters, Nick Buisman** and **Robin van Dijk**.

## Game Description

The game we are making is called the Binding of Zelda. The game will be a dungeon crawler inspired by the original Legend of Zelda and games like the Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon. The game will have four areas. The levels within the areas are procedurally generated. Each area will have different enemies based on the overall theme of the area (a forest area will have animal-inspired enemies and a death-inspired area will have skeleton-based enemies).

The engines we are considering for the development of this game are **monogame** and **godot**.
Monogame: https://www.monogame.net/.
Godot: https://godotengine.org/.
